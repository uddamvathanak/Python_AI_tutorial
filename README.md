## Your Learning Path: From Python Basics to AI Projects

This comprehensive tutorial covers the key areas required to effectively use Python for AI development:

### **1. Python Fundamentals for AI**

*   Core Syntax: Variables, data types, control structures (if/else, loops).
*   Building Blocks: Functions, modules, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
*   Data Handling: Essential file I/O operations.

### **2. Data Wrangling & Analysis: NumPy & Pandas**

*   **NumPy:** Mastering numerical operations with arrays.
*   **Pandas:** Efficient data manipulation with DataFrames and Series.
*   Data Cleaning: Techniques for preprocessing real-world data.
*   Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand data patterns.

### **3. Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn**

*   Core Concepts: Supervised vs. unsupervised learning paradigms.
*   Model Building: Implementing classification and regression algorithms.
*   Evaluation: Understanding model performance with key metrics.
*   Optimization: Feature engineering/selection, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning.

### **4. Deep Learning Introduction: PyTorch**

*   Neural Network Basics: Perceptrons, activation functions, feedforward networks.
*   Training Essentials: Backpropagation and gradient descent concepts.
*   **PyTorch:** Building and training your first neural network models.
*   CNN Primer: Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks for image tasks.

### **5. Natural Language Processing (NLP) Essentials**

*   Text Handling: Preprocessing, tokenization, and vectorization methods.
*   Core Tasks: Introduction to sentiment analysis and Named Entity Recognition (NER).
*   Word Embeddings: Understanding foundational concepts.

### **6. Computer Vision (CV) Basics**

*   Image Manipulation: Getting started with OpenCV.
*   Image Classification: Applying CNNs to image data.
*   Key Applications: Introduction to object detection and face recognition.

### **7. Capstone Project: Customer Churn Prediction**

Apply your skills to a practical, end-to-end AI project. Predicting customer churn is a common and valuable business problem, making this an excellent portfolio piece.

*   **Problem:** Build a model to predict which customers are likely to stop using a service.
*   **Skills Applied:** Data acquisition (Kaggle datasets), cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, model selection (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting), training, evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, AUC), and crucially, model explainability (SHAP/LIME).
*   **Outcome:** Translate technical results into actionable business insights.
